Welcome to the Property Transfer Files Information Page.
NOTE: THIS README FILE ONLY PERTAINS TO FILES ON OR BEFORE JULY 2010!



Property Transfer information processed by the Department of Taxes will be available
on a weekly basis from this site.	
 
We will be writing a file out each week which will contain the property transfer 
records which we have processed the previous Monday through Friday.  The file will 
be named PT_YYYYMMDD.txt described as follows:


      PT	=	Property Transfer
  YYYYMMDD	=	Friday/Saturday of the week returns were entered ex: 20020104


The files will be in ASCII text format and have two record types, a return record 
for each transfer and as many name records as needed for that transfer (maximum
of 90 name records).  The return record and name(s) records must have the same 
information in the first 15 characters of the key field.   
 	

NOTE:	THESE FILES CONTAIN RAW DATA IN ASCII TEXT FORMAT AND ARE NOT USEABLE UNLESS 
        YOU DOWNLOAD THEM AND THEN LOAD THEM TO YOUR DATABASE/SPREADSHEET SOFTWARE.
 
The description of these record layouts can be obtained by downloading the file 
called pt_layout.txt.
 
Some of the fields contain codes, for a list of codes you can download the file 
called pt_codes.txt.

There is also a file called towncode, which contains each town code and the town name.

The Department of Taxes does not provide direction or assistance in the use of 
the data on this site other than what is contained in the provided documentation.   

NOTE: 
      Each year there is a file labeled with the year, ex. ptXXXX.zip where the XXXX is 
      the year. These files are zippedpacked (pkzip) and will need to be unpacked  
      using pkunzip, which can be downloaded by right clicking on the file called 
      "pkunzip.exe".
